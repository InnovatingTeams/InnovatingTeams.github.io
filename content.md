### Build software well

The most effective way to build software today is:

 * **Work together** in teams. Share not just the planning but the actual work.
 * **Learn constantly** across the organization. Your productivity constraint is your rate of learning.
 * **Prove it** at every step. Never let a mistake linger.
 * **Refactor** everything. Reduce the cost of change to both your product and your process so you can adapt.
 * **Use data** to validate your learning. Run experiments to guide your changes.

Working this way:

 * Reduces **time to market**.
 * Reduces **cost of change** in market conditions.
 * Increases **productivity and efficiency** (work completed per dollar).
 * Increases **effectiveness** (value delivered per time).
 * Increases **customer satisfaction**.
 * Increases **team morale**.

Innovating Teams helps you build teams that work in this way.

### How teams get better

We have observed that teams tend to follow a standard progression, whether they receive outside coaching or not. Teams follow this same trajectory regardless of business domain or company size. Team-specific context changes only two things: the detailed practices they implement to achieve each step and how far they need to progress in order to succeed.

This happens because:

 * Everyone wants to be a **Lean Startup/Enterprise** using **validated learning** to direct their products and processes. That learning comes from **running experiments**. However,
 * Experiments require a **low cost of change**, a **low cost to revert**, and **extremely high quality**. Wins come from accumulating small gains. Each experiment discovers a subtle advantage for one option. High quality is required to be able to detect the subtle signals; low cost is required to allow us to run many experiments. However,
 * Current products have high cost of change and low quality: **technical debt**. No team can afford to stop production and pay off technical debt. They need to pay technical debt incrementally without slowing down production or introducing bugs. This requires a process change. However,
 * The company suffers from **process debt**. Reporting structures, processes, meetings, and traditions all reinforce today's ways of working. It is hard to learn new approaches, expensive to agree on changes or run experiments, and difficult to tell if any given change had positive impact.

Teams tend to start at the bottom and work their way back up this progression. They stop when either the environment doesn't let them progress further or their current way of working meets business needs.

### We can help

You own your growth along this trajectory. We can speed you up and decrease cost and risk. We can help with 5 phases of your ongoing transformation:

1. Create **learning teams**. Create high-performance teams that get better every day. Techniques include:
 * Structure organizations for success. Create single-assignment, cross-functional teams.
 * Align teams using chartering, performance chain analysis, and champions network.
 * Help teams share work and learning via mobbing and pair programming.
 * Train managers in servant leadership. Train individual contributors in consent-based decision-making and team accountability.
 * Teams drive their own experiments and habit changes via retrospectives.
 * Visualize the work via iterative (Scrum boards), continuous (Kanban, value chain), or plan-driven (phase-gate, spiral) approaches.
 * Visualize the process via working agreements, simple rules, value chain, cross-team interaction agreements, and failure demand metrics.
 * Enable change by Anzaneering&mdash;intentionally identifying forces and systems that threaten personal safety and fixing them.
 * Identify and leverage points of resistance&mdash;structural or people&mdash;to keep your changes focused on what your business actually needs.
2. Get **legacy code** under control. Pay off technical debt incrementally, without spending productivity or introducing bugs. Techniques include:
 * Make atomic, known-safe changes via mechanized refactoring.
 * Extract the spec from existing code via acceptance and unit testing.
 * Create new code spec-first via test-driven development.
 * Gain single- and multi-team alignment with legacy code strategies.
 * Visualize progress with legacy code metrics and visualizations.
3. **Ship at will**. Attain continuous delivery or whatever shipping cadence matches your market. Techniques include:
 * Automate everything in your build and ship process.
 * Enable either versioned or progressive release, with automated rollback in either case.
 * Enable zero-downtime deployments.
 * Leverage your specs to automate verification.
 * Simplify tools to reduce cost of release and operations.
 * Script and automate operations to attain a DevOps or NoOps approach.
 * Visualize success with release metrics and visualizations.
4. **Validated learning**. Plan based on data and change plans easily. Run experiments to deeply learn about your customers. Techniques include:
 * Define valid experiments.
 * Replace backlogs and other plans with data to reduce the amount of time spent building the wrong thing.
 * Enable cross-team data sharing to enable decentralized, global optimization.
 * Visualize validated data with models.
 * Understand the market with business and customer behavior metrics.
5. Create a **learning organization**. Create an innovation network from your learning teams that learns constantly and adapts to changing business circumstances. Techniques include:
 * Use Working Out Loud to enable informal cross-team collaboration and alignment on product and process, and to enable discovering new potential partner teams.
 * Create a culture of collaboration via decentralized champions and catalysts.
 * Create an innovation network by enabling temporary multi-team relationships via contracting.
 * Visualize learning with information spread and innovation metrics.

### Tooling

Teams share some common tooling gaps. We are building tools to address those needs. All tools are designed to integrate well with your existing tools. We don't force teams to transition toolsets; we provide options they can use to enhance their own work.

We are currently building the following tools.

* **Destiny** helps teams own their destiny. Teams can track experiments and habit changes and see improvement over time. Metrics allow teams to gain credit from managers for learning from both successful and failed experiments.
 * Maintain your current team charter. See all your agreements in one place. Ramp up new hires faster and keep managers aware of how you work.
 * Easily define experiments or habit changes using our templates.
 * Search for other teams that have encountered the same problems you are having and see what experiments they ran and what results they got.
 * Search your own team's experiment history to show what you have learned and recall the results of long-ago experiments.
 * Report on experiment outcomes in a consistent, simple format so that managers can see your team's improvement and reward it.
 * Track long-term effects of habit changes to ensure that your habits stick and your processes continue to deliver value.
 * Report on habit changes and long-term improvements to management.
 * Guide your retrospectives, keeping them on track to deliver experiments and habit changes&mdash;real change.
 * Maintain and improve system models over time. Progressively develop understanding of how your team works and fails so that you can make more effective changes.
* **Who's  on it?** helps anyone in the organization understand the organization as a whole. It dynamically shows your current innovation network so that you can see who is doing what and who is partnered with whom on what.
 * Teams manage relationships via lightweight interaction agreements.
 * Measure health of relationships via metrics against the agreements.
 * Team members and managers alike can see when relationships are missing or need improvement. People can decide where to optimally spend attention.
 * Search by topic to see which teams are actively working on that topic.
 * Integrates with Yammer to search in-team and cross-team discussions for topics.
 * Get reminded about relationships which have served their purpose so they can be officially dissolved and free the teams to innovate independently.
 * Discover areas of the product or process where consistency is more valuable than innovation. Collaboratively come to agreements over time to optimize the whole network.
