# Hello world

I'm alive!

Retrospectives: I can help you make them tight, fast, deliver data to drive decisions, and deliver improved results every couple of days.

1 month proscriptive, then 1.5 years following the graph in any way that works for you. Then unknown&mdash;we lack data to make statements at this point, due to the small number of teams who wrote down what they did.

Prescriptive guidance. Do the following:

1. Performance Chain Analysis.
1. Pause for manager and champ buy-in check. Leaders learn about servant leadership. Not shielding the team&mdash;too active. Representing team's decisions to rest of company.
1. Charter. Empower the team; be explicit about decision-making. Pick who maakes what calls, focusing on those the team now makes.
1. Start pairing. In shared space. Strong style or Popcorn. No driver/navigator. Coding tasks only; add others as skills improve. Experiment format. Or start mobbing.
1. Do 2-day process improvement cycle. My style retros.
1. Refactor to introduce names. Detailed paragraphs. Key refactorings. All mechanized. Whole value replaces primitive obsession.
1. Start using sprints. Don't change planning, but execute in sprints with sprint projections.
1. Pause to build fluency.
1. Test as spec. Fluent assertions.
1. Vertical decomposition. Make your sprint-level work items smaller.
1. Pause to build fluency.
1. Make units. Without mocks. Simulators and APIs for boundaries. Dependency elimination principle for within boundaries.
1. Spec via units. Each business rule must come explicitly from one unit. No emergent behavior. Events & testable binding.
1. Explicit, temporary relationship contracts with partner teams.
1. Pause to build fluency.
1. Prevent bugs. Get to 2-star capabilities in your own way. XP or micro-services are  known ways.
1. In partner team relationships, focus on reducing the level of interaction required to succeed.
1. Pause to build fluency.
1. Change your planning process. Rolling wave or continuous flow.

Template for each detail page:

# Name
## tl; dr
-- label indicating level of evidence. Options are: untested, anecdotal, reproduced, consistent
-- label indicating presence of alternatives (& listing key ones)
## Why?
What immediate value will be delivered by adding this practice? What is the instant return?
## Why not earlier?
What capabilities are required in order to succeed?
## Why not later?
What does this give that other things will build on? What, specifically, will build on that?
## Out of scope
## Applicable context
When does this technique apply? When should you consider an alternative? When should you skip the category altogether (don't use an alternative either)?
# Learning to do
## Required fluencies
## Doing it in your work
## Measuring progress / expectations
## Required tool capabilities (to use or to avoid)
## Feedback mechanisms
## Katas
## Theory
## Resources
### Training
### Tools (specific tool recommendations)
# Practicing
## How to recognize fluency (when to stop focusing on this)
## Ongoing feedback
## Expected results (measure and value)
## Reporting
# Evidence
## Supporting
## Refuting
## Discussion of alternatives
Includes link to a thing about choosing between alternatives.

Pages describing choosing between alternatives are really the page about a capability (or set) and the various ways to get it. They need a template too.
