# Context

We are assuming a software organization:

* of 50-150 individuals,
* with legacy code (roughly 1MLoC / developer, roughly 500 known open bugs / developer),
* with hierarchical reporting structures,
* where work is executed by individuals according to specialized skills,
* who make product decisions based on the Highest Paid Person's Opinion (HiPPO),
* under competitive pressures that prevent them from stopping or even significantly slowing production in order to fix things that they know are broken.

Who wants to be an organization:

* of the same 50-150 individuals,
* who release at will,
* who use build-measure-learn from Lean Startup to make product decisions,
* who get a little better each day and fix each problem as it arises,
* with much higher productivity,
* and enjoy work.

This is a typical transformation. It requires changes in process, tooling, skill, culture, expectation, and structures. These changes need to be synchronized across time and teams so that they support each other.

Here's the base recipe we customize to make it happen.

> Note:what we don't do is at least as important as what we do. Customization usually alters how we do the things we do and may add some context-specific actions, but it does not include removing things from the "do not do" section. Doing these things, especially early in the process, tends to bog down a transformation.

# Week -4

First we get the right people in place to support the transformation to come.

The champions align strategic intent. This determines the transformation plan. Champions understand the approach; they know why they will do certain things and can explain that when asked.

Prepare the kickoff. Technical champions learn key micro-skills.

Clearly indicate that change is happening and supported at all levels. Align strategic intent throughout organization. Institute structural changes that enable continuous improvement.

# Week 1

Teams start changing themselves. Start reading code by using tool-driven refactoring to introduce names. Reduces cost to implement stories that involve changing legacy code, while also reducing defects in that code. Teams create learning environments by sharing work.

# Week 2

Teams deal with the pain that comes from starting to share work. Teams master changing themselves. Start extracting specs from legacy code. Whole team improves understanding of what the product actually does.

# Week 3

Teams use testability to drive context-neutral coding. Code size starts to reduce as a side-effect of normal working. Team learns
