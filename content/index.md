# Welcome to your new site

This is just markdown. All the source is in the `content` directory.

1. Edit package.json and _config.yml to update URLs, title, and so on to match your site.
1. Write whatever you want. With the usual formatting. Make pages in the content folder, named to match the page URL.
1. Update the readme template if you need to. It is in the docs folder. The readme.md file in the root is built from that template with every build.
1. Build the site.
