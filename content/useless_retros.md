{ Lead example. Sound familiar? }

The following is a common story abbout a failing Agile transformation. Rather, about one which succeeded poorly. Does this sound familiar?

We started by changing to 2-seek sprints. We did a planning meeting at the beginning of each iteration, a stand-up each day, and a retrospecctive at the end. Suddenly everyone knew what everyone else was doing. Cooperation soared. Productivity improved by a good 20%, and time to market dropped from years to 3 months.

But not everything was rosy. We were spending so much time in meetings. Quality dropped and has stayed low. Productivity gains were eroding. We complained about problems in retros and management never really fixed them. So we made some changes.

* We went to monthly sprints. This is a closer match to our customer anyway. They can't take updates that fast. This decreased the number of meetings we had.
* Daily standups were pointless: most of the time a task takes a couple days to complete, so there's a lot of "same as yesterday" standups. We reduced them to twice per week so they always contain new information.
* We made the retro sorter. We were able to find all the problems in 20 minutes anyway, so we keep the meeting tight and short so that people will show up.
* We focused on creating action items from the retro. Most of the problems require solution outside the team, so must be done by management. Action items make clear what we need from them. We solve the internal problems informally during the sprint, not at retro.

This time we found almost no change. Our productivity remained about the same. But things were less frustrating, because of fewer meetings. So we're going to keep working this way. It's better than anything we've done before. We seem to have plateaued. Looks like we've gotten all the value out of Agile. We can probably tweak for a few 5% improvements, but it is time to look for the next big improvement.

Sounds familiar? It does to me: this is the most common story of abject failure that I see. As a comparison, these are the baseline measures I expect as a min-bar to consider an agile transformation successful:






1-star: share work, constant alignment / change direction, learn constantly
2-star: release at will, change product after release without introducing side effects
3-star: run product experiments, stop trusting opinion
4-star: run culture / organization experiments, stop trusting opinion




These days nearly everyone is doing retros. Yet I still get a lot of calls to help teams improve their release cadence or fix quality problems. These are exactly the sort of problem that all teams should be able to solve internally: the solutions are well-known and demonstrated to not depend much on local context. Why is the team stuck?

Because the retro (as commonly executed) is useless. Retros, as performed by most teams, do not give the outcomes needed. Because most teams don't do the retro right. When a team changes how they do retros, they get a different result.

sizzle
tl;dr
what people do: bitching sessions
what people do: plan and do actions, not achieve objectives
Why do retros at all? - what is the problem you are trying to solve
What do you want? - what outcome do you want from your retro process
What do you fear? - what do you want to avoid in your process
Baseline results of retros done well.
Coming soon...
