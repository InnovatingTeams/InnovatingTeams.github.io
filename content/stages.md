> At a high level, teams transition through a series of stages. These stages are similar from team to team, so can provide you a roadmap to plan and understand your own transitions.

# Attaining Fuency

Many leaders and teams mistakenly montior *proficiency*: what your team can do. However, outcomes are determined by *fluent proficiency*: what your team does by habit, on its worst days, when the context works against them. Therefore we encourage teams to maximize fluency at each capability before going on. This will make it easier to learn later capabilities and will also start delivering improved results now.

Furthermore, many tansitions focus on behaviors and actions: what people do. This gives variable results. The problem is that we care about results, not actions. And results are determined primarily by the system; the same action in different systems has different results. We will use performance chain analysis to plan our transition. This lets us tie system changes to changes in results, so that we can adjust the system and measure the right outputs.

Finally, some transitions are concrete and prescriptive, while others leave a lot of room for adjusting to the context. Both work some of the time. Looking at a large number of transformations, we observe that there are a small number of starting places, a remendous number of intermediate states, and a small number of desired target states. For this reason, our method begins highly prescriptive then quickly broadens to guidance and help choosing your own path, and then finishes rigorously with prescriptive guidance to reach the final stages.

## Fluency

Put simply, you are fluent at whatever techniques are your default. The techniques you use under stress and when no one is looking at how you work. This is why fluency is so much more important than proficiency. Most of the time, you will use your default behavior. Even when you are "on good behavior" and using your latest skills, you will practice them in a way similar to your defaults. Thus most of the effort that goes into your project will use your default techniques.

Attaining fluency in new techniques allows my team to change its defaults. Then we get different results without intentional effort.

> It's like losing weight

This is much like losing weight by exercising. Many people try to lose weight by going to the gym and lifting weights. They add some special practice that they do when on their besst behavior. Yet even if they manage to make it to the gym regularly, this accounts for only 30 minutes of each day. Their bodies tend to look like they would from the other 23.5 hours of the day.

Other people instead find some activity they really enjoy. They get into cycling or walking. They integrate it into their day. They commute to work on the bike, buy groceries by bike, sell the car, and go to social events by bike. They never do intensive bike workouts, and yet over time they tend to become healthy. They became fluent cyclists, integrating it into everything they do. It became their default. And so their body reflects the results of cycling all the time, without them paying any attention to losing weight or making it out to a "cycling event."

We do the same with techniques. We practice each one in detail, integrating it into our daily routine. We ignore theory or special efforts. We focus on the details: what we do day in and day out. Each transition tweaks one or two small techniques. Each takes a day or two to complete. And because each changes our default, we start getting healthy quickly.

## Stages

Your transition should start showing results in the first 48 hours. And it should continue to show improvement every 48 hours for the first 15 years (probably longer, but that's all we have data to support so far).

> Every team is different but there are consistent patterns

This happens because a transition is fundamentally iterative. There are course-grained stages of development, medium-grained practices, and find-grained techniques. Each business, team, and individual is continually learning techniques. Each technique gives a real business advantage.

The techniques cluster into practices. Learn enough techniques in an area, and you will start to see patterns. You will be able to distill out a general practice and predict which new techniques will be effective in your context. You will find each practice develops in levels. As you accumulate more techniques related to a specific practice, your approach to that practice as a whole will deepen and you will gain new advantages from it.

The practices support each other. As you develop in your level in multiple reinforcing practices, you will discover new ways to think about your business. You will distill general principles. These principles allow you to approach business decisions in fundamentally different ways from those who do not follow the same principles.

Teams see common patterns at all 3 levels.

* Certain techniques are easy to learn by themselves and give immediate results. Others require pre-reqs in order to deliver value. Teams tend to start with the techniques that deliver value, then move on to the ones that those techniques unlock.
 * This optimal order varies slightly from team to team, but not much.
 * There are some alternative techniques&mdash;multiple techniques that give the same result. Differrent teams choose different alternatives. However, they still tend to go through the techniques in the same order, acquiring some technique to give each outcome in the same sequence as other teams do.
* Each practice has several levels. Each level unifies hundreds of techniques into a single way of working. Teams tend to progress in a uantized fashion. They execute a set of practices at particular levels as they develop fluency in new techniques. Once enough techniques are learned, they rapidly change to a new level of practices. These levels seem to be pretty consistent from team to team.
* Principles develop as the teams are able to practice that principle. Thus they naturally follow the advancement of levels in practices. As sets of those principles come together, the business fundamentally shifts its way of working. These shifts are similarly quantized and consistent from team to team: each business goes through similar stages in the same order, though how they practice each stage may vary.

It is easiest to understand these patterns from the general to the specific, even though the specific preceeds the general in the real world (practice trumps theory).

Based on the [Agile Fluency Model&trade;](http://agilefluency.com/), we regularly see the following stages:

1. Become a set of independent learning teams
2. Become able to run experiments on your product
3. Become a learning organization about customers and products
4. Become a learning organization

# Become a set of independent learning teams



# Become able to run experiments on your product



# Become a learning organization about customers and products
