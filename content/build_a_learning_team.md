# Continuous Learning Teams

The first step of a successful Agile transformation is to create learning teams. This involves the following shifts

| Capability | Traditional solution | Agile solution |
| Work ownership | Individual accountability | Team accountability |
| How work gets done | Individuals loosely organized into work groups (often called teams) contribute to a variety of products as assigned by managers | High-performance teams take on chunks of work and get it done, then roll to the next chunk of work |
| Decision-making | Important decisions are made by managers; the more important the decision, the higher up the hierarchy it goes. | Important decisions are made by the team that does the work, because they have the best data. |
| Job of managers | Make decisions | Frame options and ensure teams feel comfortable making decisions |
| Individual contributor job | Specialize in some narrow field of value to the company. Go deep, the apply that wherever the company needs it. | Specialize in several fields at once. Go deep in all of them and apply the right skills to the problems you face. |
| Business philosophy | Skill is expensive. We will buy specialists and then combine them as needed to solve problems. We need to use our expensive specialists efficiently. | Skill can be learned. We create a learning organization, so skill acquisition is cheap. Building trust and teams is expensive. We create strong teams that can solve any problem and learn quickly, then empower them to find and solve important problems. We optimize for system throughput&mdash;effectiveness, not efficiency. |
| Key practices | Resource allocation, budgeting, prediction, planning. | Shared work execution, team-scale process self-improvement, stakeholder empathy |
| Emergent results | High coordination costs. Planning efficiency determines product cycles, not customer need. Contention on key skills limits productivity. Morale is low; hiring is expensive. | Low coordination costs. Direction can change at any moment (with both good and bad results). Key skills are always locally available. Morale is high; hiring is less expensive. |

Managers have long claimed that creating learning organizations was a Good Thing. However, no one has been able to define a systematic approach to creating learning organizations. Those that appear have a business advantage, but seem to get there via luck.
